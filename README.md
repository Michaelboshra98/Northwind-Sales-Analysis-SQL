Python
1. Load Data to data frames
We began by importing the pandas library to facilitate data manipulation. A loop was implemented to load Excel file into separate data frames. In total, we created five data frames corresponding to different tables.

 

2. Inspecting Data
To understand the structure and quality of our data frames, we created a function to retrieve important metrics:
•	Shape (rows and columns)
•	Duplicates
•	Column details: name, type, number of nulls, most frequent value, and percentage of the most frequent value.
 


Function to Inspect Data
Findings
•	Duplications: We identified duplicates present in all data frames.
•	“df_orders” data frame: Notably, that data frame contained a column combining "Id" and "Date" which required splitting.
 
3. Data Cleaning
Step 1: Remove Duplicates
We removed duplicates from all data frames to ensure data integrity.
 


Step 2: Split and Rename Columns in "df_orders"
In the "df_orders" data frame, we split the combined "Id&Date" column into two columns.

 

Step 3: Date Manipulation
1.	Change Data Type: The "Date" column's data type was changed to integer to get max to determine date format was "DMYYYY".

 
2.	Create dictionary to map “Month” to number month in "month_no".
 

3.	Concatenate "month_no” with the right 4 character in “Date” ( year) in new column "month_year"
 
4.	Create a new column named "day," which will contain the count of characters in the "Date" column subtracted from the count of characters in the "month_year" column.
 

Step 4: Formatting Dates
1.	Convert "month_year" from "MYYYY" to "MMYYYY" and "day" from "D" to "DD". Finally, concatenate the "day" with "month_year" in “OrderDate”.
 
2.	Concatenate “day” to with “month_year”.

 
3.	Convert “OrderDate” string to proper datetime format.
 
Step 5: Drop Unnecessary Columns
We removed any columns that were not needed for further analysis.
 
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
Step 1: Data Preparation
•	Initial Data Frames:
1.	The code first creates two data frames:” Product_price_list” and “orders_price_list”.
2.	“Product_price_list” excludes non-essential columns such as “ProductName”, “SupplierId”, “UnitCost”, etc., while “orders_price_list” drops the Id column.

 
Step 2: Data Merging
•	Join Data Frames:
1.	A right join is performed on the two data frames based on product IDs to create “price_list”.
2.	The code calculates the price difference between the new and old prices.
 

Step 3:  Filtering and Cleaning Data
•	Filtering Differences:
1.	The code filters “price_list” to keep only those records where there is a price difference.
 
•	Dropping Unnecessary Columns:
1.	It drops columns that are no longer needed, including the price difference and duplicates.
 

Step 4:   Type Conversion and Testing
•	Type Conversion:
1.	The Id column in “df_orders” is converted to an integer type for consistency.
•	Testing Data Consistency:
1.	A test is performed to ensure the computed sum of old prices multiplied by quantity matches the total amount for specific order IDs.
 
Step 5: Further Data Manipulation
•	Creating Additional Data Frames:
1.	The code prepares a new data frame "orderId_oldprice" for unique orders with old prices.
 
•	Calculating test2:
1.	You filter “df_orders” to include only those rows where the 'Id' is less than or equal to 250.
2.	You then sum the 'TotalAmount' for these filtered rows and store it in test2.
3.	Comparing test and test2 to check if the value of test is equal to test2.
 
•	Adding Price Version:
1.	A new column “PriceVersion” is added to categorize orders as 'Old' or 'New'.

 
Step 6:   Final Data Merging and Cleanup
•	Merging with Original Product Data:
o	The final step involves merging the “price_list” with the original “df_product” data frame to add the “OldPrice”.
 
 
5. Save data frames to CSV
Finally, we saved all cleaned data frames to CSV format using UTF-16 encoding to ensure compatibility when uploading to SQL Server.
 
5. Summary
The steps taken to load, inspect, clean, and save data from Excel files into data frames. Each stage ensured that data quality was maintained, allowing for accurate further analysis. All data frames were successfully saved for future use.

SQL
1. Database Creation
Establish a new database for data storage and analysis.
2. Table Creation
Create tables within the database to store structured data.
3. Data Insertion from CSV Files
Import data from CSV files generated by Python scripts into the database.
4. Summary
The steps to create a database, establish a table, modify column names for better data representation, and import data from CSV files into the database. These actions will facilitate effective data modeling and enhance relationships within the dataset.

Data Visualization
Introduction: Why We Chose Power BI
We chose Power BI for this project because it offers powerful data visualization and reporting capabilities while allowing us to integrate and connect directly with SQL databases. By using Power BI, we could easily transform our cleaned and structured data into interactive dashboards. After using Python for data cleaning and SQL for data modeling, Power BI helped us ensure that the data relationships were accurately transferred before we focused on visualizing the insights.
Step 1: Importing Data from SQL
For this project, we imported data directly from an SQL database into Power BI, allowing us to work with live and up-to-date data without manual file transfers.
	Opened Power BI Desktop.
	Clicked "Get Data" from the Home ribbon and selected SQL Server as the data source.
	Entered the server and database details for the SQL connection.
	Used a Direct Query connection to ensure the data in Power BI remained updated in real time as it was refreshed from the SQL database.
	Selected the required tables from the database and clicked "Load" to import the data into Power BI.
	Once loaded, the data appeared in the Fields pane and was ready for use in creating visualizations.

Step 2: Verifying Relationships in Power BI
Before creating visualizations, we ensured that the relationships between tables, created in SQL, were transferred correctly into Power BI.
	Moved to the Model view to inspect the relationships between the tables.
	Checked that all relationships between tables were active and correct.
	Confirmed that the relationships mirrored the structure we had established in SQL, with all necessary links between tables in place.


 
Step 3: Designing Visualizations
In this step, we selected the most appropriate chart types for each data point to effectively convey insights and make the dashboard interactive and user-friendly.
To make our analysis comprehensive and user-friendly, we decided to analyze the data from four key perspectives: Overview, Customers, Products, and Suppliers. We implemented a navigator to organize the dashboard into these sections, allowing the client to switch between different views easily. Below is a breakdown of the visualizations within each perspective, explaining the chart types, why we chose them, and what insights they provide.
